Below you can find out how to use the new system.

There are two windows, Tile Creator and Tile Editor.

* The tile creator is used to create new custom tiles that you want to use in the generator.
* To add new sprite options add your sprite **(64x64 + Pixels Per Unit of 64 recommended)** to the sprite atlas found at Resources/TileTextures.
* Currently you can only change the tile health this is going to be expanded to allow for the tile type ,colour, block drop, speed and more.
* After you have modifed the tile variables in the window click create tile. This will add it into a TileDatas file in the Resources folder, this might move in the future.
* If there is no file, one will be created when you make your first tile.

* If you have at least one tile made, opening the Tile Editor window will give you options to change the tiles variables aswell as showing its ID.
* You can also remove the tile if you no longer need it.
* When removing a tile all of the other tile ids will be reordered.

Finally the **CLEAR ALL TILE DATAS removes the Tile Data file**.
